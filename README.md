# NBA-Prediction

## Description

This is an NBA game & MVP prediction project. The main idea is to scrape a desired amount of data from basketballreference.com, clean the scraped data, turn it into a proper data frame and then use said data to train the game and MVP prediction models. After training and properly configuring the game predictor model we can then use it to predict the winner of future NBA matchups. After doing the same for the MVP predictor model we can then predict future MVPs.
