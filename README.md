# NBA-Prediction

## Description

This is an NBA game & MVP prediction project. The main idea is to scrape a desired amount of data from basketballreference.com, clean the scraped data, turn it into a proper data frame and then use said data to train the game and MVP prediction models. After training and properly configuring the game predictor model we can then use it to predict the winners of previous and future NBA matchups. After doing the same for the MVP predictor model we can then predict previous and future MVPs. Lastly, we can analyze our prediction accuracy and make changes to our models and data to improve their ability to properly predict MVPs and winners of games.
